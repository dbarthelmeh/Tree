# Tree
This is a .py file that adds up the nodes of a tiny bonzai tree (5 nodes).  This exercise came from the video [Introduction to Trees (Data Structures & Algorithms #9)](https://youtu.be/1-l_UOFi1Xw?t=354) (time stamped)
I followed along with his [solution in the same video](https://youtu.be/1-l_UOFi1Xw?t=409), but adapted the java script to python and I had to solve an attribute error.
